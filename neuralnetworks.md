# Neural networks

## Hyperparameters 
Examples of hyperparameters in a neural network are
- Number of hidden units
- Learning rate
- Batch size (the number of sub samples given to the network after which parameter update happens. A good default for batch size might be 32. Also try 32, 64, 128, 256, and so on)
- Number of epochs (the number of times the whole training data is shown to the network while training)
