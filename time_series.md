# Time series

## ARIMA
A non-seasonal ARIMA model is classified as an ARIMA$$(p,q,d)$$ model, where

- $$p$$: the number of autoregressive terms (the lag order)
- $$d$$: the number of non-seasonal differences needed for stationarity
- $$q$$: the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation
